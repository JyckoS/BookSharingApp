            <h1>What is MMU Book Sharing?</h1>
            <p>Founded in 2024, MMUBookSharing.com is the home to the community for MMU Students
                where they are able to share the books they have and borrow books they need.
                We provide many features to ensure the best quality and the highest comfort so

            <h1>Loaning Books</h1>
            <p>
                You are able to loan your books, not only just to give them away.
                If you have a book that you want to share but be returned back after a certain
                period of time. You can loan it.
